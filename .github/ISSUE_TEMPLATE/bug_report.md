Hello! Thanks for contributing.  For the fastest response and resolution, please:

 - Make the issue title a succinct but specific description of the unexpected behavior.
   Bad: "Map zoom is broken". 
   Good: "camera.setZoom(...) throws an exception for zoom levels where no tiles exist"

 - Ensure that you have tested on a physical device, not just a simulator.

 - For build issues: Can you reproduce it on a clean install of the example app? Please include full steps to reproduce from `react-native init`

 - Include a link to a minimal demonstration of the bug, ideally a single component with one MapView. Use an example like [PointInMapView](/packages/examples/src/BugReport.tsx) as a starting point.

 - Ensure you can reproduce the bug using the latest release.

 - Only use this template for bug reports. Use the feature request template for requests, and direct general questions to Slack: https://slack.openstreetmap.us/.
